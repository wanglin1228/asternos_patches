/*
 *	Description:
 *	a) Optical transceiver EEPROM read/write transactions are just like
 *		the at24 eeproms managed by the at24.c i2c driver
 *	b) The register/memory layout is up to 256 128 byte pages defined by
 *		a "pages valid" register and switched via a "page select"
 *		register as explained in below diagram.
 *	c) 256 bytes are mapped at a time. 'Lower page 00h' is the first 128
 *	        bytes of address space, and always references the same
 *	        location, independent of the page select register.
 *	        All mapped pages are mapped into the upper 128 bytes
 *	        (offset 128-255) of the i2c address.
 *	d) Devices with one I2C address (eg QSFP) use I2C address 0x50
 *		(A0h in the spec), and map all pages in the upper 128 bytes
 *		of that address.
 *	e) Devices with two I2C addresses (eg SFP) have 256 bytes of data
 *		at I2C address 0x50, and 256 bytes of data at I2C address
 *		0x51 (A2h in the spec).  Page selection and paged access
 *		only apply to this second I2C address (0x51).
 *	e) The address space is presented, by the driver, as a linear
 *	        address space.  For devices with one I2C client at address
 *	        0x50 (eg QSFP), offset 0-127 are in the lower
 *	        half of address 50/A0h/client[0].  Offset 128-255 are in
 *	        page 0, 256-383 are page 1, etc.  More generally, offset
 *	        'n' resides in page (n/128)-1.  ('page -1' is the lower
 *	        half, offset 0-127).
 *	f) For devices with two I2C clients at address 0x50 and 0x51 (eg SFP),
 *		the address space places offset 0-127 in the lower
 *	        half of 50/A0/client[0], offset 128-255 in the upper
 *	        half.  Offset 256-383 is in the lower half of 51/A2/client[1].
 *	        Offset 384-511 is in page 0, in the upper half of 51/A2/...
 *	        Offset 512-639 is in page 1, in the upper half of 51/A2/...
 *	        Offset 'n' is in page (n/128)-3 (for n > 383)
 *
 *	                    One I2c addressed (eg QSFP) Memory Map
 *
 *	                    2-Wire Serial Address: 1010000x
